BMSA - Basic Music Streaming App (Yes, that's the name I am going with and I am a bit too lazy to change the folder names for it!).

This is a basic streaming app I am working on that allows you to self-host your music library easily. This app is currently being developed on MacOS & Android (before moving to other platforms). 

I will keep updates here as it is easier for me to keep track of everything that I am doing instead of separate folders etc. 

01/06/2025 - I have uploaded the first version of the app. Currently, it is connecting to your phone via HTTP and streaming the songs from the folder. This is all done locally. 

03/06/2025 - I have updated the app to integrate Tailscale in order to help generated QR codes in order to pair between the app on your phone and the app on your Mac. This means you can connect your music library over mobile data as well so you can take your music library anywhere. 

04/06/2025 - Improved the Android app music player. Made sure you can easily connect properly and diconnect if needed. Added ability to see the album cover art on mobile, folder struture is much better.
