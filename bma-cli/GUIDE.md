# üéµ BMA CLI Setup Guide

**A simple, step-by-step guide to get your music server running on Raspberry Pi or any computer.**

## What is BMA CLI?

BMA CLI is a music server that lets you stream your music collection to your phone from anywhere. It's perfect for Raspberry Pi but works on any computer running Linux or macOS.

---

## üìã Before You Start

You'll need:
- A computer or Raspberry Pi with internet connection
- A folder with your MP3 music files
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A Tailscale account (free - we'll set this up)

---

## üîó Step 1: Set Up Tailscale (For Remote Access)

**Tailscale lets you access your music from anywhere in the world securely!**

### Create Tailscale Account:
1. Go to https://tailscale.com/
2. Click "Get started for free"
3. Sign up with Google, Microsoft, or email
4. **Keep this browser tab open - you'll need it later!**

### Install Tailscale on your Raspberry Pi/Computer:

**On Raspberry Pi or Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

**On macOS:**
1. Go to https://tailscale.com/download/mac
2. Download and install the Tailscale app
3. Open Tailscale from Applications

### Connect to Tailscale:
1. In terminal, type:
```bash
sudo tailscale up
```

2. You'll see a message like:
```
To authenticate, visit: https://login.tailscale.com/a/xxxxxxxxx
```

3. **Copy this URL and open it in your browser**
4. Log in with the same account you created
5. Click "Connect" or "Authorize"
6. You should see "Success! You are now connected to Tailscale"

**‚úÖ Tailscale is now ready! Your device has a secure IP address that works from anywhere.**

---

## üöÄ Step 2: Install Go Programming Language

BMA CLI is written in Go, so we need to install it first.

### On Raspberry Pi or Ubuntu/Debian:

**Option 1: Try the system Go first (might be too old)**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang-go
go version
```

**If you see Go 1.19 or older, use Option 2 to install Go 1.20+:**

**Option 2: Install newer Go manually (recommended for Raspberry Pi)**
```bash
# Remove old Go if installed
sudo apt remove golang-go

# Download and install Go 1.20 for ARM64 (or ARM32 for older Pi)
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.14.linux-arm64.tar.gz

# For older Raspberry Pi (32-bit), use this instead:
# wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.14.linux-armv6l.tar.gz

# Extract and install
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.14.linux-arm64.tar.gz

# Add Go to your PATH
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify installation
go version
```

You should see "go version go1.20.14 linux/arm64" or similar.

### On macOS:
1. Go to https://golang.org/dl/
2. Download the macOS installer
3. Double-click the downloaded file and follow the installer

---

## üì• Step 3: Download BMA CLI

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to where you want to put BMA CLI:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```

3. Download the code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/picccassso/BMA.git
```

4. Go into the BMA CLI folder:
```bash
cd BMA/bma-cli
```

---

## üî® Step 4: Build BMA CLI

1. Download the required components:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

2. Build the program:
```bash
go build -o bma-cli .
```

3. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x bma-cli
```

---

## üéØ Step 5: First Run (Setup)

1. Start BMA CLI for the first time:
```bash
./bma-cli
```

2. You should see something like:
```
==================================================
üéµ BMA CLI Setup
==================================================
Setup server is running at: http://localhost:8080/setup
Open this URL in your web browser to configure BMA CLI
==================================================
```

3. **Important**: Keep this terminal window open! Don't close it.

---

## üåê Step 6: Web Setup

1. **Find your Raspberry Pi's IP address** (you'll need this to access the setup page):
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```
   You'll see something like `192.168.1.100` - this is your Pi's IP address.

2. **Open your web browser** on your laptop, phone, or any device on the same WiFi network

3. **Go to the setup page** using your Pi's IP address:
   ```
   http://[YOUR-PI-IP]:8080/setup
   ```
   
   **Example**: If your Pi's IP is `192.168.1.100`, go to:
   ```
   http://192.168.1.100:8080/setup
   ```

   **Note**: Don't use `localhost` - that only works if you're browsing directly on the Pi itself!

3. You'll see the BMA CLI setup page with 3 steps:

### Step 1: Tailscale Setup
- **You should see a green checkmark** ‚úÖ saying "Tailscale is configured and authenticated!"
- This means the Tailscale setup from Step 1 worked correctly
- **If you see a red X** ‚ùå, go back to Step 1 and make sure Tailscale is properly installed and connected
- **If you see a QR code**, use the Tailscale app on your phone to scan it, or visit the shown URL

### Step 2: Music Directory
- **Enter the path to your music folder**
- Examples:
  - `/home/pi/Music` (Raspberry Pi)
  - `/Users/yourname/Music` (Mac)
  - `/home/yourname/Music` (Linux)
- Click "Validate Directory"
- You should see: "‚úÖ Valid music directory! Found X music files."

### Step 3: Complete Setup
- Review your settings
- Click "Complete Setup"
- You should see: "üéâ Setup complete! BMA CLI will now restart as a music server."

---

## üéµ Step 7: Your Music Server is Ready!

After setup completes, you'll see:

```
============================================================
üéµ BMA CLI Music Server
============================================================
Music Library: /path/to/your/music
Server running at: http://localhost:8080
Ready for connections from BMA mobile apps
============================================================
```

**Congratulations! Your music server is now running!**

---

## üß™ Step 8: Test Your Server

1. Open your web browser
2. Try these addresses to test:

### Check if server is working:
```
http://localhost:8080/health
```
Should show: `{"status":"healthy"}`

### See your music library info:
```
http://localhost:8080/info
```
Should show details about your music collection

### List all your songs:
```
http://localhost:8080/songs
```
Should show a list of all your music files

---

## üì± Step 9: Connect Your Phone with QR Code

Once you have the BMA mobile app:

### **Easy QR Code Pairing (Recommended):**

1. **Open the QR code page** in your web browser:
   ```
   http://[PI-IP]:8080/qr
   ```
   Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8080/qr`

2. **Open the BMA app** on your phone

3. **Look for "Add Server" or "Scan QR Code"** in the app

4. **Scan the QR code** displayed on your screen

5. **Your phone will automatically connect!** ‚úÖ

### **Manual Connection (Alternative):**

**For Local Access (same WiFi):**
1. Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network  
2. In the BMA app, manually enter: `http://[PI-IP]:8080`

**For Remote Access (anywhere in the world):**
1. **Install Tailscale on your phone**:
   - iPhone: Get "Tailscale" from App Store
   - Android: Get "Tailscale" from Play Store
2. **Log in with the same Tailscale account** you created in Step 1
3. **In the BMA app, enter your Tailscale URL**: `http://100.87.136.73:8080`

**üåç With Tailscale, you can access your music from anywhere in the world!**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "go.mod file indicates go 1.20, but maximum version supported by tidy is 1.19" OR "undefined: time.DateOnly"
**Solution:** Your Raspberry Pi has an older Go version. You need Go 1.20 or newer. Go back to Step 2 and use **Option 2** to install Go 1.20:

```bash
# Quick install of Go 1.20 for Raspberry Pi
sudo apt remove golang-go
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.14.linux-arm64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.14.linux-arm64.tar.gz
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
go version
```

Then try building again:
```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o bma-cli .
```

### Problem: "Permission denied" when running ./bma-cli
**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x bma-cli
```

### Problem: "Port already in use"
**Solution:** Another program is using port 8080. Try:
```bash
sudo lsof -i :8080
```
Then stop that program or restart your computer.

### Problem: "No music files found"
**Solution:** 
- Check your music folder path is correct
- Make sure you have MP3 files in that folder
- The folder needs MP3, M4A, FLAC, or WAV files

### Problem: Can't access setup page from web browser
**Solution:**
- **Don't use `localhost`** - that only works on the Pi itself
- **Use your Pi's IP address instead**:
  ```bash
  hostname -I
  ```
  Then go to `http://[PI-IP]:8080/setup`
- Make sure the terminal with BMA CLI is still running
- Make sure both devices are on the same WiFi network
- Check for typos in the web address

### Problem: Tailscale setup shows red X or QR code
**Solution:**
- Check if Tailscale is running: `sudo tailscale status`
- If it says "Logged out", run: `sudo tailscale up`
- Follow the authentication link that appears
- Wait a minute and refresh the setup page

### Problem: Can't access music server remotely
**Solution:**
- Make sure Tailscale is running on both devices
- Check your Tailscale IP: `tailscale ip -4`
- Make sure both devices are logged into the same Tailscale account
- Try `http://TAILSCALE-IP:8080/health` to test connection

## üõë How to Stop BMA CLI

In the terminal where BMA CLI is running:
- Press `Ctrl + C` (hold Ctrl and press C)

---

## üîÑ How to Run Again Later

1. Open Terminal
2. Go to the BMA CLI folder:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/BasicStreamingApp/bma-cli
```

3. Start it:
```bash
./bma-cli
```

Since you already did setup, it will start directly as a music server!

---

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run BMA CLI Automatically on Startup (Advanced)

If you want BMA CLI to start automatically when your Raspberry Pi boots up:

1. Create a service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/bma-cli.service
```

2. Add this content (change the paths to match your setup):
```ini
[Unit]
Description=BMA CLI Music Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/Desktop/BasicStreamingApp/bma-cli
ExecStart=/home/pi/Desktop/BasicStreamingApp/bma-cli/bma-cli
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)

4. Enable the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable bma-cli
sudo systemctl start bma-cli
```

Now BMA CLI will start automatically every time you boot your Raspberry Pi!
